# Autonomous Vehicle Network using Lego Mindstorms EV3
This project implements a self-driving vehicular network using Lego Mindstorms EV3 with MAPE-K feedback loop system. 

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- [SE4AS - Mindstorms EV3 Autonomous Vehicle.pdf](SE4AS%20-%20Mindstorms%20EV3%20Autonomous%20Vehicle.pdf): Project Report

## Source Code

The source code is organized into the following directories:

- [/src/ev3_av_1](/src/ev3_av_1): Normal Vehicle
- [/src/ev3_emergency_vehicle](/src/ev3_emergency_vehicle): Emergency Vehicle
- [/src/ev3_pc_server](/src/ev3_pc_server_emergency): Main Server
- [/src/ev3_pc_client](/src/ev3_pc_client): PC Client to simulate the third vehicle/Admin

The source codes in ev3_av_1 and ev3_emergency_vehicle are to be executed in the Lego Mindtorms EV3 devices after [installing](https://pybricks.com/install/mindstorms-ev3/installation/) Pybrick on it. The ev3_pc_server needs to be run on a linux environment.
